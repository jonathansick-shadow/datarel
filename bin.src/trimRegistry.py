"""trimRegistry.py [-o OUTPUTREGISTRY] INPUTREGISTRY INPUTDATA

This command trims an input registry INPUTREGISTRY to contain only the rows
relevant for the CCDs specified by the INPUTDATA file.  It does this by
copying the input registry to the output registry (which defaults to the name
"newreg.sqlite3" and must not yet exist), selecting the appropriate rows into
new tables, dropping the old tables, renaming the new tables, and vacuuming
the entire file to compact it.  It works on both ImSim and CFHTLS registries,
as it only relies on the visit and id columns that are common to both.

The INPUTDATA file must be formatted for the job office.  It starts with an
">intids" line specifying which dataset identifier values are integers (as
opposed to strings).  A list of dataset identifiers is then given, each of
which consists of key/value pairs.  The keys must be consistent from dataset
to dataset, although they can be reordered.
